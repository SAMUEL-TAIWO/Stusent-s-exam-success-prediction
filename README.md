# Student Success Predictive Analytics Project üìäü§ñ

## Overview
Welcome to the Student Success Predictive Analytics project! This project is aimed at leveraging data science techniques to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on study hours and their scores in the previous exam.

## Dataset
### Name: `student_exam_data_new.csv`
### Objective: Predicting exam success using data science methodologies.
- **Features:**
  - Study Hours (numeric): Time spent preparing for the upcoming exam.
  - Previous Exam Score (numeric): Student's score in the previous exam.
  - Pass/Fail (binary): Target variable; 1 represents a pass, 0 represents a fail.

## Key Questions Explored
1. **Proportion of Student's Current Exam Score (Pass/Fail)**
   - Analyzed pass/fail ratios to understand overall exam performance.

2. **Relationship between Top 10 Largest Previous Exam Scores, Study Hours, and Current Exam Score (Pass/Fail)**
   - Explored correlations for insights to improve student outcomes.

3. **Relationship between Bottom 10 Smallest Previous Exam Scores, Study Hours, and Current Exam Score (Pass/Fail)**
   - Investigated connections between low scores, study hours, and exam results.

4. **Relationship between Top 10 Longest Study Hours, Previous Exam Score, and Current Exam Score (Pass/Fail)**
   - Examined the impact of study hours on performance for the most dedicated students.

5. **Relationship between Bottom 10 Least Study Hours, Previous Exam Score, and Current Exam Score (Pass/Fail)**
   - Analyzed factors contributing to lower study hours and their impact on exam outcomes.

6. **Top 10 Largest Scores in the Previous Exam's Score**
   - Highlighted top performers in the previous exam.
 
## KEY GOALS
-  Predictive Modeling: Develop a robust predictive model using logistic regression.
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover insights through in-depth analysis of the dataset.
-  Feature Importance: Identify key features influencing exam success.
-  Recommendations: Propose actionable suggestions based on the analysis.


## How to Contribute
